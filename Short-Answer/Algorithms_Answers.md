#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(1) because no matter how big the input, the output stays constant


b)O(n log n) because at first the number of operation increases as the number of input increase but becomes lienar as the number of input increases.


c)O(n) because it return operations twice the input but since you dont count the constant, it is still O(n)

## Exercise II

def break(floor):
      broken = 0
      not_broken = 0 
      difference = 0 
      if floor > f:
        broken += 1
      else:
        not_broken +=1
    return difference = broken - not_broken

O(n)
